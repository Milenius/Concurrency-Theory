A branching Process of net $N$ is a pair $B = (K, h)$ where $K= (Q, V, G, M_0)$ is an [[Occurance Net]] and h is a [[Net Homomorphism]] from $K$ to $N$ such that $$\forall v, v' \in V: ( {}^\circ v= {}^\circ v' \land h(v) = h(v') \Rightarrow v =v'$$
```

- The condition on $h$ asserts that a transition of $N$ can be chosen at most once in $K$.
# Remarks:
- Each [[Distributed Runs]] is a branching Process
