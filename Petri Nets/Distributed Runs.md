```ad-important
A distributed Run of a Net $N$ is
1. a labelled [[Causal Net]] $K_N = (Q, V, G, M)$
2. in which each transition $t\in V$ is a [[Action]] of $N$
A distributed run $K_N$ of $N$ is *complete* if the marking $M={}^\circ K_N$ represents the initial marking $M_0$ of N and the marking $K_N^\circ$ does not enable any transition in N.
