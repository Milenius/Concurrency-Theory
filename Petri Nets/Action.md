An *action* is a labelled net $A = (Q, \{v\}, G)$ with ${}^\circ v \cap v^\circ = \emptyset$ and ${}^\circ v \cap v^\circ =Q$.
```

Actions are used to represent transition occurrences of elementary system nets. If $A$ represents
transition $t$, then the elements of $G$ are labelled with in- and output places of $t$, and $v$ is labelled with $t$.
